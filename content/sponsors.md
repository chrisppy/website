Callout: "Awesome people make Serpent OS awesome."

Serpent OS wouldn't be possible without the hard work of the core [Team](/team/) and the support of
our sponsors. Developing and hosting a Linux distribution is an expensive endeavour, and we truly
appreciate all support to alleviate that financial strain.

#### Hosting

Our partnership with [fosshost.org](https://fosshost.org) provides us with hosting for our main
[Phabricator instance](https://dev.serpentos.com) and our [download server](https://download.serpentos.com).
Additionally, they host our downloads & repository on their dedicated mirror network. Through the hard
work of fosshost, we're able to build scale into our architecture from the very start.
